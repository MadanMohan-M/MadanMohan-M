Final-year Computer Science (AI & ML) student at Malla Reddy Engineering College, actively building skills in Machine Learning, Generative AI, and LLM-based systems.

I’m currently working on the practical implementation of Large Language Models, including RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, LangChain-based applications, vector databases (FAISS), and backend APIs using FastAPI. My learning focus is on real-world, production-style AI systems, not just theory.

I enjoy collaborating on AI/ML and GenAI projects, exploring applied research ideas, and learning from experienced engineers through mentorship and technical discussions. I’m open to internships, entry-level roles, and collaborative opportunities where I can grow while contributing meaningfully.
